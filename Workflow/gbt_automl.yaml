# GBT+AutoML Workflow: Run H2O AutoML
#
# Part of the project Gradient Boosted Trees and AutoML project and GitHub repository at
# https://github.com/gradient-ai/Gradient-Boosted-Trees-and-AutoML
#
# See that URL for instructions on how to use, under "To run the Workflow (advanced)"
#
# This file runs the same analysis as the Notebook automl_in_h2o.ipynb, but abbreviated code and minimal text
# A model is output that can be deployed via Java (see the project GitHub repository), the same as from the Notebook
# This YAML calls gbt_automl.py
#
# Dataset ID
#
# The user needs to create their own Gradient managed dataset for job outputs, using the same name as here: "gbt-automl"
# See the project GitHub repository for details on how to do this
